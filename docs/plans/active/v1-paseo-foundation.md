# Execution Plan: Meetless V1 Release Readiness

## Current State

- `plan_revision`: `v5`
- `current_frontier`: `MANAGED-TRANSCRIPTION-FAKE-BACKED-FOUNDATION`
- `state`: `READY_FOR_BOUNDED_IMPLEMENTATION`
- `depends_on`: the accepted managed-transcription policy in product authority and ADR0005; proof must precede production backend, UI, provider-credential, or external-store work
- `candidate`: no implementation candidate; MAS/RevenueCat structural candidate `9f73a7199a65735219d98c2df0eff8de8a2ddcc9` is accepted reusable evidence only
- `pending_ruling`: technical acceptance of a future bounded fake-backed foundation candidate
- `blocked_by`: no product-contract blocker remains; external App Store profile, RevenueCat configuration, sandbox purchase, upload, review, and publication gates remain separately open
- `next_action`: implement and verify the bounded fake-backed foundation proof; do not begin production backend rollout, provider credential use, UI reconciliation, signing, upload, or publication in that frontier

## Ownership And Authority

Date: 2026-08-30; reconciled 2026-08-31

- Owner: `v1-paseo-foundation` owns the managed-transcription foundation contract,
  residual M7, paused `M7-F29-NOTARIZE-STAPLE-VERIFY`, and TCC R3.
- Owned scope: managed-transcription authority and entry criteria; residual M7
  release gates; paused M7-F29; TCC R3 candidate acceptance.
- Authority: ADR0001, ADR0003, ADR0004, ADR0005, product monetization policy, and the macOS artifact-validation specification where its non-DMG mechanics still apply.

## Outcome

Keep one compact execution record for the remaining Meetless V1 release work.
The accepted M0–M6, design, package, signing-preparation, and recording-start
history is completed evidence; this plan tracks only the live frontiers listed
in `Current State`.

The owner changed the release path on 2026-08-30 from direct DMG to the Mac App
Store for RevenueCat Shipaton 2026. On 2026-08-31 the owner also replaced the
initial Premium gate: Ask and user-supplied transcription remain free; Premium
funds Meetless-managed transcription. This plan owns that foundation contract,
the store sandbox, RevenueCat purchase integration, App Store Connect
submission, and launch-evidence frontier.

## Ownership And Boundaries

- Residual M7 owns the remaining release, legal, target, and distribution gates.
- `SHIPATON-MAS-REVENUECAT` supersedes the direct-DMG distribution frontier but
  does not erase its historical proof. It owns sandbox packaging, purchase
  mechanics, App Store Connect readiness, submission, and launch evidence.
- `MANAGED-TRANSCRIPTION-FAKE-BACKED-FOUNDATION` owns one bounded vertical proof
  of the accepted identity, device, quota, duration, job, cleanup, expiry, and
  local-publication contracts. It does not authorize production provider
  credentials, production backend rollout, external store mutation, or final UI.
- `M7-F29-NOTARIZE-STAPLE-VERIFY` remains paused under its separate owner hold;
  no notarization, stapling, upload, publication, or credential inspection is
  authorized by this reconciliation.
- `TCC-V1-CORRECTION-R3-ACCEPTANCE` owns only candidate rebind and Lead ruling.
  Its implementation candidate preserves the accepted permission and rollback
  behavior while adding renderer intent binding and recoverable app/surface
  failure handling.
- The accepted R1 correction changed host artifact ownership/linking,
  authorization-state lock lifetime, MAS entitlement validation, and the former
  Premium chat composition. Its build, sandbox, native purchase, and runtime
  boundary proof is reusable structural evidence. Its Ask gate is superseded
  product behavior and is not authority for the managed-transcription gate.

## Stable Authority

- [ADR0001 — maintained Paseo fork and pin](../../decisions/0001-maintained-paseo-fork.md)
  owns Paseo provenance and the exact dependency revision.
- [ADR0002 — direct notarized macOS DMG](../../decisions/0002-direct-notarized-macos-dmg.md)
  is superseded distribution history; its retained artifacts remain direct-DMG
  evidence only.
- [ADR0003 — runtime isolation and host ownership](../../decisions/0003-meetless-runtime-isolation-and-host-ownership.md)
  owns runtime topology, app boundary, companion transport, renderer endpoint,
  readiness, and shutdown.
- [ADR0004 — recording host and capture permission boundary](../../decisions/0004-recording-host-and-capture-permission-boundary.md)
  owns the recording host/helper and microphone/system-audio permission boundary.
- [ADR0005 — Mac App Store and RevenueCat](../../decisions/0005-mac-app-store-and-revenuecat.md)
  owns store distribution, sandbox, product identifiers, purchase mechanics,
  and managed-transcription account, quota, duration, lifecycle, and expiry
  contracts.
- [Premium product policy](../../product/monetization.md) owns user-visible free,
  paid, trial, quota, device, purchase, restore, expiry, and temporary-data
  behavior.
- [macOS artifact validation](../../specs/macos-artifact-validation.md) owns
  candidate, package, sign, re-sign, and validation stages.

## Live Frontier: TCC-V1-CORRECTION-R3-ACCEPTANCE

`TCC-V1-CORRECTION-R2` is superseded history and has no live owner. R3 is the
only active TCC frontier; its permission policy is now anchored by
[ADR0004](../../decisions/0004-recording-host-and-capture-permission-boundary.md).

The current candidate keeps MeetingStore bootstrap available so permission
recovery can render. It still forbids Meeting/session creation and native helper
spawn before both typed microphone and system-audio permissions are authorized.
Permission mutations require the exact packaged renderer Host/Origin and a
fresh one-use user-intent token. Invalid, replayed, foreign, or malformed
requests fail before native invocation. Status/decode/settings failures clear
checking, stay visible, and leave an actionable Recheck path; absent runtime
state is `Proposed`, while typed `notDetermined` is `Will ask`.

The candidate must be rebound to this clean-main snapshot before Lead acceptance.
No app launch, real permission request, TCC or Settings change, signing,
installation, package mutation, Keychain access, notarization, upload,
publication, or user-data deletion is part of this frontier.

## Residual M7 And Paused M7-F29

The accepted package and signing-preparation evidence remain pre-release only.
Residual M7 still includes the unresolved Human/legal inventory decisions,
supported-target limits, real clean-install permission attribution/persistence,
and release acceptance. M7-F29 retains the exact DMG and owner hold from the
archived ledger; it may resume only after the owner supplies a validated
`notarytool` profile name and explicit resume direction.

M7-F29 is no longer on the selected release path. Do not resume notarization or
stapling for Shipaton; retain it only as direct-DMG history.

## Live Frontier: MANAGED-TRANSCRIPTION-FOUNDATION-CONTRACT

### Outcome

Define the authority and smallest credible proof for Meetless-managed
transcription before implementation. The accepted direction keeps Ask,
existing transcripts, citations, provider/model controls, and user-supplied
transcription providers/API keys free. RevenueCat Premium gates only
Meetless-managed transcription, where the publisher's provider credential
remains backend-only.

Convex-first is the intended V1 backend direction. It will be evaluated as the
owner of verified subscription lineage, device credentials, atomic quota
ledger, managed jobs, and temporary uploads. It does not replace local
`MeetingStore` ownership of transcripts, citations, and meeting evidence.

The managed allowance is a backend-configured 50 hours (180,000 seconds) in
each subscription-anchored monthly period, without rollover. The seven-day
trial receives five hours (18,000 seconds). Each period snapshots its assigned
limit, so a later reduction cannot change an already-started period.

`TranscriptionProvider` remains the execution abstraction. Provider/engine
selection may change independently from payment mode; entitlement, admission,
quota reservation, and charging stay outside provider implementations.

### Progress

- [x] Select Mac App Store distribution and supersede direct DMG.
- [x] Accept the replacement product direction at Lead review boundary:
  `ACCEPT_WITH_REQUIRED_DECISIONS` on 2026-08-31.
  - Ask, existing transcripts, citations, provider/model controls, and BYOK are
    free.
  - Premium gates only Meetless-managed transcription.
  - Convex-first is the intended V1 direction, pending the foundation proof and
    contracts below.
- [x] Preserve the former Ask Premium implementation as historical candidate
  evidence only. Its product gate is superseded and must not be treated as
  current policy or copied into the managed-transcription path.
- [x] Add the native RevenueCat/StoreKit adapter and authenticated renderer boundary.
  - RevenueCat 5.87.1 is pinned by SwiftPM and the real SDK target links.
  - `npm run build:native` now produces and checks the SwiftPM-owned
    `native/macos-host/.build/release/MeetlessHost` artifact; install and package
    workflows copy this artifact and refuse a missing or fallback binary.
  - Native focused tests build through the same SwiftPM core and prove Premium
    waits do not block authorization clear/shutdown or grant access after revoke.
  - The native socket normalizes status, purchase, cancellation, restore, and
    unavailable results without exposing receipts, keys, or raw SDK errors.
- [x] Establish the structural Mac App Store sandbox baseline.
  - A distinct contract pins Electron 41.2.0 `mas` arm64, Apple Distribution,
    an App Store provisioning profile, container-owned state, and
    security-scoped external export.
  - Parent application-group and inherited-child entitlement closures are exact
    and validated by `npm run validate:macos:app-store`; positive and negative
    contract proofs passed on 2026-08-31. The Team ID/application-group input is
    build-scoped and contains no credential.
- [x] Decide and promote the managed-transcription product contracts into
  durable product/ADR authority.
  - Owner accepted quota, trial, device, restore, server duration, temporary
    data, job lease, expiry, refund/revocation, and free Ask/BYOK behavior on
    2026-08-31.
- [ ] Complete the bounded fake-backed foundation proof defined below.
- [ ] Reconcile the executable Ask gate and Premium UI only after product
  authority is updated and implementation is explicitly authorized.
- [ ] Apply the profile-backed App Sandbox entitlement and In-App Purchase configuration.
- [ ] Replace unrestricted writable paths with container/export-safe behavior.
- [ ] Produce and validate a sandbox development build.
- [ ] Configure RevenueCat project, entitlement, offering, and products.
- [ ] Configure App Store Connect app, subscription group, products, prices, trial, and agreements.
- [ ] Prove sandbox purchase, cancellation, restore, and offline/free behavior.
- [ ] Capture icon, screenshot, demo, privacy, review, and launch evidence.
- [ ] Upload the exact build, wait for processing, and submit it to App Review.
- [ ] Record the public Mac App Store URL after approval.

### Accepted Direction And Dependency Boundaries

- The backend derives the stable billing/quota account from server-verified App
  Store subscription lineage. RevenueCat App User ID, client entitlement state,
  and client-selected subscriber IDs are lookup data, not authorization proof.
- Each installation receives revocable device credentials. Enrollment, StoreKit
  transaction exchange, refresh credentials, and device private-key material
  remain trusted-native-host and Keychain scoped; the renderer sees typed state
  only.
- Restore Purchases binds a new installation to the existing verified
  subscription and shared quota account without resetting quota or automatically
  revoking another Mac. At most three Macs may remain enrolled.
- Short-lived access credentials authorize managed backend requests. A
  longer-lived, rotatable device/refresh credential remains in Keychain.
- macOS prepares bounded AVFoundation audio chunks before upload. Backend engine
  adapters may change without changing the client-facing managed provider or
  free BYOK path.
- Audio and provider output are temporary backend data. The durable transcript
  remains local unless separately authorized.
- Family Sharing remains disabled for V1.

### Accepted Owner Contract (2026-08-31)

- Monthly and annual products receive 180,000 seconds in each
  subscription-anchored monthly period without rollover; the seven-day trial
  receives 18,000 seconds. Restore and product changes do not reset a period,
  and limit changes apply only to the next period.
- One verified subscription account may enroll three Macs. Restore binds a new
  Mac to the same account and quota without automatically revoking an old Mac.
- The server derives billable duration from validated sample count on one 16
  kHz mono PCM WAV timeline; client and provider duration claims are not
  authority, and overlapping microphone/system sources are not double charged.
- Temporary audio, orphan uploads, provider results, and transcripts in transit
  have a 24-hour TTL. Jobs have a six-hour lease, and acknowledged local
  publication triggers earlier result deletion.
- A validly admitted job may finish after natural expiry within its lease;
  verified grace remains active, while refund or revocation stops work when
  observed. Ask and BYOK remain free; only managed transcription requires
  Premium.

### Foundation Proof Acceptance Boundary

The authorized next implementation frontier is one bounded fake-backed
vertical proof. It must demonstrate:

1. a verified subscription lineage enrolls a device key; App User ID-only or a
   client-selected subscriber ID fails authorization; restore binds a second
   installation to the same quota account; and a credential can be revoked;
2. one managed audio job uses stable subscriber/audio/chunk idempotency, atomic
   quota reservation and settlement, injected duplicate requests and crashes,
   and exactly one ledger charge for the same audio;
3. the chosen duration authority rejects a false client duration;
4. temporary uploads/results are cleaned after success, failure, cancellation,
   expiry, and orphan recovery without persisting a transcript as durable
   backend meeting data;
5. the managed result publishes through the existing local transcript/citation
   lifecycle, while BYOK bypasses Premium/quota and Ask remains free; and
6. real AVFoundation chunks satisfy the selected Convex upload/action limits,
   target-market latency is measured against available regions, and action
   retry/concurrency behavior is explicit rather than assumed.

These criteria authorize only the bounded fake-backed proof. None is completed
by this authority reconciliation, and production backend/provider credentials,
external store changes, and final UI remain outside its scope.

### Accepted Reusable R1 Structural Evidence (2026-08-31)

- [x] SwiftPM is the single host build owner. `MeetlessHost` is built through
  the pinned RevenueCat 5.87.1 dependency, and build/install/package workflows
  reject an artifact without real RevenueCat symbols.
- [x] Runtime authorization revalidates leases without holding its lock across
  Premium status, purchase, or restore waits; native focused tests cover clear,
  shutdown, revocation, and stale-lease denial.
- [x] The MAS contract requires the parent application-group entitlement and the
  inherited child sandbox closure, with explicit build-time Team ID/application-
  group inputs and deterministic positive/negative validation.
- [x] Provider/control discovery does not construct the Premium transport. The
  former Ask/retry Premium gate was proven on the candidate, but that behavior
  is now superseded and is retained only as evidence that admission can occur
  before persistence/execution.
- [ ] No RevenueCat project, App Store profile, signing, upload, sandbox
  purchase, App Review, or public listing evidence exists in this correction.

### Risks And Recovery

- App Sandbox may reject the current nested Electron, Node, helper, listener, or
  writable-path topology. Preserve the direct-DMG package path while developing
  a distinct MAS target; do not weaken existing validation to make MAS pass.
- Store and RevenueCat credentials are external. Keep public SDK configuration
  build-scoped; never persist private keys or issuer secrets in the repository.
- Convex currently offers no APAC hosted region; upload latency and regional
  data placement must be measured before selecting a production deployment.
  Region choice, upload/action limits, nonautomatic action retries, workflow
  result persistence, and concurrency must be explicit in the foundation proof.
- Convex mutations can own atomic admission and ledger transitions, but neither
  Convex nor the provider call is assumed exactly-once. Stable idempotency,
  reservation/settlement, ambiguous outcomes, and cleanup are application
  contracts.
- The local keychain has Apple Development and Apple Distribution identities,
  but the installed profiles inspected on 2026-08-30 are iOS-only and none
  matches macOS `com.meetless.app`; a Mac App Store profile must be created and
  installed before a certificate-backed sandbox package can be proven.
- App Review and store processing are external gates. Record exact states and
  do not claim publication before the public listing is observed.

### Validation

- Foundation, once authorized: the fake-backed identity, quota, idempotency,
  duration, cleanup, local-publication, and free-path proof above.
- Focused, after authority reconciliation: free Ask/BYOK policy, managed
  transcription admission, purchase adapter, renderer boundary, and sandbox
  entitlement tests.
- Integration: packaged sandbox app with StoreKit/RevenueCat sandbox purchase,
  restore-to-new-installation, device enrollment, and managed transcription.
- Repository: typecheck, focused tests, build, and a MAS-specific package validator.
- External: App Store Connect processing, App Review submission, and public listing.

Historical R1 structural validation observed on 2026-08-31 includes `npm run typecheck`,
the targeted Premium/MAS/composition Vitest run (18 files, 117 tests),
`npm run build:native`, SwiftPM host/test builds, and positive/negative MAS
validator runs. The broader `npm run test:focused` run remains non-green only
in baseline areas outside this correction: missing Expo vector-icons module,
three signing-fixture diagnostic expectations, one artifact-resign diagnostic
expectation, and one readiness startup deadline timeout. These are reported in
the peer handoff and are not reclassified as R1 proof. The broader composition
suite also has its existing Expo module failure and an M6 transport fixture
timeout; the focused R1 chat composition proof passed independently. None of
that evidence proves the new managed-transcription product gate, identity,
quota, backend, upload, or cleanup contracts.

## Completed Evidence

- [M7 and TCC historical ledger](../completed/v1-paseo-foundation-m7-accepted-history.md)
  preserves the full pre-reconciliation active plan, including accepted and
  superseded candidate identities, validation, owner holds, TCC R2/R3 evidence,
  and residual release gates. It is evidence, not current authority.
- [M0–M6 and design history](../completed/v1-paseo-foundation-m0-m6.md) preserves
  the accepted product and architecture foundation.
- [post-M3 harness evidence](../completed/post-m3-electron-harness-improvement.md)
  preserves the accepted installation-only harness capability.

## Reconciliation Record

- Base snapshot: clean `main@3ab08d4f45699ee1dee49b75c6b0caf40086bdae`.
- The former 4,943-line active ledger moved to completed evidence; no evidence
  bytes were removed from that history.
- Executable references to the former active plan are replaced by stable ADR or
  specification/product authority. No semantic plan lint or new harness behavior
  is introduced. Harness doctor remains installation-only.
- `test/evidence/m3/20260819T153402Z-live/manifest.json` is immutable historical
  evidence and remains byte-identical.
- 2026-08-31 `PLAN_RECONCILIATION v4`: Lead accepted the managed-transcription
  direction with required decisions. The MAS/RevenueCat candidate
  `9f73a7199a65735219d98c2df0eff8de8a2ddcc9` is closed structural evidence;
  its Ask gate is superseded. The current frontier is docs/foundation contract
  work, and implementation remains blocked on the five owner/authority gates.
- 2026-08-31 `PLAN_RECONCILIATION v5`: the owner accepted all five managed-
  transcription contracts. Product policy and ADR0005 now own the free Ask/BYOK,
  quota/trial, three-Mac restore, sample-count duration, 24-hour TTL, six-hour
  lease, natural-expiry completion, and refund/revocation behavior. The next
  frontier is the bounded fake-backed foundation proof.
- This v5 reconciliation changes product and ADR authority plus this plan. It
  changes no implementation, executable contract, package, external service,
  credential, or store state.

## Validation

This docs-only authority reconciliation requires consistency checks only:
whitespace validation, stale Ask-gate search across current authority, active-
plan index consistency, and confirmation that implementation paths are unchanged
in this turn. It does not self-accept TCC, the fake-backed proof, production
managed transcription, or any external release stage.
